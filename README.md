A data collection app aimed towards researchers, final year students, etc that utilises a quantitative study methods and needs data / feedback.

## About

Inspired by Last year students, researchers and data collectors in general, we see that a lot of people rarely get a large amount of organic feedback / data from form collections such as google forms / Microsoft forms. It's either a small amount from their friends / peers or a large amount due to using scripts, bots, or even paying a third party who'll fill it in at random.

So, our team planned to make a form based data collection platform where anyone can get responses from anywhere, Utilizing tools like the Self Protocol to ensure that both the user and the recipient are actual people. The questionnaires will then be put into a hub where people can view all the available questionnaires.

The user first makes an account using their email, they can then start making as many questions as they like by clicking a button. Once the user is done with the questions, they will then add a description to their form explaining what it is and also assign the form to a category so it'll be filtered / easily searched for in the hub later on. The user will also need to stake a selected amount of eth as a reward if the target amount of recipients is met, after that they're all set.

To encourage people to fill in these feedback forms / questionnaires. the user will first stake an amount of eth that will be given to a selected amount of recipients (determined by the user), the user will then set a number of responses they require. If the amount satisfies the initial amount then the participants can actually have a chance to "win" the staked eth.
Winning conditions can either be done selectively by selecting the form that helps the user the most or if the user doesn't want to go through the hassle, they can just set it to be given at random. If the user opts to "select a winner" but doesn't do so within a set time limit, the staked eth will automatically given to a random recipient.

The form hub is where people from all over the world can access and see all the available forms, separated by categories of the forms (Think of twitch's homepage with categories to different types of streams). Recipients that visit the hub can filter or even search specific questionnaires / feedback forms that they have knowledge in (say if you're and engineer you'd look for stuff with tech / stem in their description). Anyone can fill in the forms but they need to be logged in first via email and prove that their unique via the Self protocol.

Though this is initially intended for organic form collection, we believe the base tech ideas can be put in other use cases, leaving the idea very open for improvement in the future
